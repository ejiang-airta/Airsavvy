Issue #,Description,Status,Symptom,Fix Applied,Code Snippet
001,Book Now button does not link directly to selected flight but to airline homepage,Unresolved (Bug 001),"Clicking 'Book Now' takes user to airline website, but not directly to the selected flight",Tabled for future improvement; requires deeper investigation into airline URL structures,N/A
002,Oxylabs API returns limited flight results (even when more are available on Google Flights),Unresolved (Limitation 002),"Only 4 flights are returned despite requesting more (e.g., 10)","Implemented pagination, but API still limits results. Needs Oxylabs support confirmation",payload['pages'] = 2  # Request more pages
003,SSL certificate verification error when calling Oxylabs API,Resolved,requests.exceptions.SSLError: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED,"Installed/upgraded OpenSSL, set correct Python SSL certificate path","import certifi
requests.post(API_URL, json=payload, verify=certifi.where())"
004,Unauthorized API error when calling Oxylabs API,Resolved,API Error: 401 - Unauthorized,Verified and corrected API credentials,"response = requests.post(API_URL, auth=(os.getenv('OXYLABS_USERNAME'), os.getenv('OXYLABS_PASSWORD')))"
005,Oxylabs API 'google_flights' source not supported,Resolved,API Error: 400 - Unsupported source,Changed API source from 'google_flights' to 'universal',payload['source'] = 'universal'
006,User cannot select return date for round-trip flights,Resolved,Selecting 'Round-trip' does not show return date input,Modified UI to dynamically show return date when 'Round-trip' is selected,"if trip_type == 'Round-trip': return_date = st.date_input('Select Return Date', departure_date + timedelta(days=7))"
007,'Direct' vs. 'Any' flight type filter not working,Resolved,Selecting 'Nonstop Only' still shows connecting flights,Added correct filtering logic to API payload and response processing,if flight_type == 'Nonstop Only': flights = [f for f in flights if f['type'].lower() == 'nonstop']
008,"API returns prices with commas, causing parsing error",Resolved,"ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '1,011'",Modified code to remove commas before converting price to integer,"price = int(flight['price'].replace('$', '').replace(',', ''))"
009,Dynamic selection of 'Top N' flights instead of fixed Top 3,Resolved,"Previously hardcoded Top 3 flights, now user can select 3-10 flights",Added slider input for user selection and updated display logic,"top_n = st.slider('Select number of top flights:', 3, 10, 3)"
010,API results showing fewer flights than expected despite pagination,Resolved,"Pagination was not applied properly, resulting in only first-page results",Modified response processing to merge results from multiple pages,for result in data['results']: flights.extend(result['content']['results']['flights']['results'])
011,Parsing issue when 'd' (days) is present in flight duration,Resolved,Crash when processing flights with durations like '1d 6h',Updated parsing logic to handle both days and hours,duration = sum(int(x[:-1]) * (24 if 'd' in x else 1) for x in flight['duration'].split())
012,Hardcoded username/password in the script,Resolved,Security risk: credentials stored directly in code,Replaced with environment variables using os.getenv(),username = os.getenv('OXYLABS_USERNAME')
013,Plan to switch from Oxylabs to Skyscanner API,Enhancement Request,Oxylabs has limitations; may not be the best choice long-term,Documented as future enhancement,N/A
014,Need to store information in SQLite instead of local memory,Enhancement Request,MVP stores everything in memory; no persistence,Documented as future enhancement,N/A
015,cURL request to use env variables resulted in error,Resolved,Invalid type for parameter render,Changed render parameter to 'HTML',"-H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{""render"": ""html""}'"
016,VS Code virtual environment not recognized,Resolved,Virtual environment packages not detected in VS Code,Configured VS Code interpreter and session to use correct virtual environment,Set Python interpreter in VS Code settings to virtual env path
